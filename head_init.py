head_init.py — Final layer initialization (student-implemented).

Students: Implement `init_last_layer` to control how the new classification
head is initialized before fine-tuning begins. The skeleton below uses
Kaiming uniform weights and zero bias — you are expected to experiment with
alternatives (e.g. Xavier, orthogonal, small-scale random, learned bias init).

    """Initialize the weights and bias of the final classification layer in-place.

    This function is called once during model construction (see model.py).
    Modify it to experiment with different initialization strategies and observe
    their effect on the "initialized head" evaluation checkpoint.

    Args:
        layer: The ``nn.Linear`` layer that serves as the new CIFAR100 head.
               Modifies the layer in-place; return value is ignored.

    Student task:
        Replace or extend the skeleton below. Some strategies to consider:
          - ``nn.init.xavier_uniform_``  — preserves variance across layers
          - ``nn.init.orthogonal_``      — encourages diverse feature directions
          - Small-scale init (e.g. scale weights by 0.01) — conservative start
          - Non-zero bias init           — useful when class priors are known
